# Maintenance Department Working Mechanism

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive working mechanism followed by the Maintenance Department when issues are raised for assets or when assets are broken or damaged. The process is designed to ensure efficient handling of maintenance requests while maintaining proper documentation and approval workflows.

## Process Flow

The maintenance process is divided into five main sections:

1. **Section A: Issue Raising**
2. **Section B: Assignment and Appointment**
3. **Section C: Examination**
4. **Section D: Approval**
5. **Section E: Billing and Closing**

---

## Section A: Issue Raising

### Step 1: Issue Identification and Reporting

**Process:**
- A staff member from any branch identifies a technical issue with an asset
- The staff member scans the barcode printed on the asset
- The system opens the asset details page
- The user provides the following information:
  - Issue title/description
  - Photographs of the broken asset or maintenance requirements
  - Priority level (Normal, Serious, or Urgent)
- The issue is submitted and queued for maintenance department review

**Key Requirements:**
- Valid barcode scan is mandatory
- Clear description of the issue
- Visual documentation through photographs
- Appropriate priority classification

### Step 2: Notification to Maintenance Department

**Process:**
- Upon issue submission, the Maintenance Department is automatically notified
- Notification includes:
  - Asset details
  - Issue description
  - Priority level
  - Reporting branch information
  - Timestamp of issue creation

**Response Time:**
- Urgent issues: Immediate notification
- Serious issues: Within 1 hour
- Normal issues: Within 4 hours

## Section B: Assignment and Appointment

### Step 3: Task Assignment

**Process:**
- Maintenance Department reviews the issue details
- Assignment is made based on:
  - Maintenance staff skill set
  - Current workload
  - Schedule availability (visible in calendar)
  - Geographic proximity to the asset location

**Assignment Criteria:**
- Technical expertise required for the specific issue
- Staff availability and current workload
- Location accessibility
- Estimated time to resolution

### Step 4: Staff Approval/Rejection

**Process:**
- Assigned maintenance staff receives notification
- Staff can either:
  - **Approve**: Accept the assignment and proceed
  - **Reject**: Decline with detailed explanation

**Rejection Handling:**
- If rejected, the issue is reassigned to another suitable staff member
- Alternative time frames are considered
- Rejection reasons are documented for process improvement

### Step 5: User Notification

**Process:**
- Once assignment is approved, the original reporter is notified
- Notification includes:
  - Assigned maintenance staff details
  - Scheduled visit date and time
  - Estimated duration of maintenance work
  - Contact information for the assigned staff

## Section C: Examination

### Step 6: On-Site Examination

**Process:**
- Assigned maintenance staff arrives at the location
- Comprehensive examination of the asset is conducted
- Assessment includes:
  - Physical inspection
  - Technical evaluation
  - Root cause analysis
  - Impact assessment

### Examination Outcomes

#### Case 6.1: Warranty/Contract Coverage
**Scenario:** Asset is under warranty or falls under seller contract
**Action:**
- Asset is not to be touched by internal staff
- Asset is prepared for transport to authorized service center
- Warranty documentation is verified
- Transport arrangements are made

#### Case 6.2: External Service Required
**Scenario:** Issue is beyond internal staff skill set or requires specialized equipment
**Process:**
- External service provider is contacted
- Service provider provides:
  - Approximate service cost
  - Estimated repair time
  - Required approvals
- Quote is submitted to Maintenance Department for approval

#### Case 6.3: Internal Repair Capable
**Scenario:** Issue can be resolved by internal maintenance staff
**Process:**
- Staff provides cost estimate for required parts/materials
- Time estimate for repair completion
- Resource requirements assessment

### Step 7: Detailed Report Submission

**Report Contents:**
- Warranty status verification
- Recommended repair approach (internal/external)
- Detailed cost breakdown
- Time estimates for completion
- Required resources and materials
- Risk assessment
- Alternative solutions (if applicable)

---

## Section D: Approval

### Step 8: Budget and Policy Review

**Process:**
- Maintenance Department reviews the examination report
- Assessment against organizational policies and budget constraints
- Decision based on:
  - Cost threshold limits
  - Departmental authority levels
  - Asset criticality
  - Available budget

#### Case 8.1: Within Department Authority
**Scenario:** Cost and scope within Maintenance Department approval limits
**Options:**
- **Accept**: Work proceeds immediately
- **Reject**: Asset is marked for scrapping with detailed justification

#### Case 8.2: Management Approval Required
**Scenario:** Cost or scope exceeds departmental authority
**Process:**
- Issue is forwarded to Management Team
- Management reviews:
  - Asset details and history
  - Cost-benefit analysis
  - Alternative solutions
  - Strategic implications
**Options:**
- **Accept**: Work proceeds with management approval
- **Reject**: Asset is marked for scrapping with management justification

### Step 9: Responsibility Assignment

**Process:**
- Assigned maintenance staff maintains responsibility until issue resolution
- Point of contact for all queries and updates
- Regular progress reporting to stakeholders
- Escalation procedures for delays or complications

## Section E: Billing and Closing

### Step 10: Resolution and Billing

**Process:**
- Once issue is resolved, billing cycle begins
- Final documentation is completed
- Asset status is updated in the system

#### Case 10.1: Asset Scrapping
**Process:**
- Asset is marked as "Scrapped" in the system
- Scrapping remarks and documentation are added
- Any salvage value received is recorded
- Disposal method and location are documented

#### Case 10.2: External Service Provider
**Process:**
- Service provider bill is received and verified
- Bill details are updated in the system
- Asset is marked as "Working Condition"
- Warranty information is updated (if applicable)
- Service provider performance is evaluated

#### Case 10.3: Internal Repair
**Process:**
- Internal repair costs are calculated and recorded
- Parts and materials used are documented
- Labor hours are tracked
- Asset is marked as "Working Condition"
- Maintenance history is updated

### Final Documentation

**Required Documentation:**
- Complete work order with all steps
- Cost breakdown and approvals
- Before/after photographs
- Parts and materials used
- Time spent on repair
- Lessons learned and recommendations
- Asset status update
